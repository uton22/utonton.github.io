		I think you're truly something special (oh)
Just what my dream are really made of (dreams are really made of)
Let's stay together you and me boy (oh)
There's no one like you around, oh baby
Uh, uh, (ooh)
Desert Storm, uh (oh woah)
Uh, uh huh, uh, uh huh, uh (oh)
Yeah, yeah, oh, uh (oh)
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I wanna be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'ma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave shopping sprees, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blues so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our names had Jackson on the ends, uh
I really like (I really like)
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (I can't explain)
I'm, so into you (so into you)
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Barts, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted (really acquainted)
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you
I really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (can't explain it)
I'm, so into you
I really like (ooh, ooh)
What I feel, when I'm with you (with you)
You're a dream come true (you're, oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you ever leave my side (ever leave my side, oh no)
'Cause it feel so right (oh baby, oh I)
I, really like
What you've, done to me (boy, you)
I can't really explain it (oh I can't explain it)
I'm so into you (I'm so into you baby)
I really like
What you've, done to me (you've done to me)
I can't really explain it (look what you've done to me)

That you keep that smile
You are my dream

I'll give my life up for you
'Cause you are my dream
And baby everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now
One day when the sky is fallin'
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause i'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
If you had my child
You would make my life complete
Just to have your eyes on a little me
That'd be mine forever
And baby everything that I have is yours

We so high off the ground
Sendin' for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from?
Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes, got me sayin'
"What a beautiful lady"
No if, ands or maybes
I'm releasin' my heart
And it's feelin' amazing
There's no one else that matters
You love me

Uh, uh huh, uh, uh huh, uh (oh)

I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I wanna be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'ma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave shopping sprees, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you

I'm, so into you
Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blues so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our names had Jackson on the ends, uh
I really like (I really like)
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (I can't explain)
I'm, so into you (so into you)

I'm, so into you
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Barts, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted (really acquainted)
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah

Gaze in your eyes, got me sayin'

When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'ma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave shopping sprees, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now

Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blues so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our names had Jackson on the ends, uh
I really like (I really like)
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it (I can't explain)

I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Barts, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted (really acquainted)
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah
